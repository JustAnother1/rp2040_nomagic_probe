RP2040 nomagic probe
====================

This firmware uses nomagic probe. It provides a gdb server interface to be used with RP2040 (The chip on the RaspberryPi pico board) over a SWD connection.

== documentation

please refer to the https://github.com/JustAnother1/nomagic_probe[nomagic probe] project for most of the documentation.

Additional documentation can be created by doing

+make doc+

the created documentation is then located in the build/doxygen/ folder.

== building and starting

The firmware can be build using make. The generated Files will be placed in the bin folder. For details try

+make help+

for this to work you (obviously) need to have make installed.
Depending on the target you are building for you might need to have additionaltools installed:

- To build for ARM Cortex-M Targets you need https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded[GCC ARM Embedded]
- to flash and program you need https://openocd.org/[OpenOCD]
- to create an *.uf2 file you need https://github.com/JustAnother1/elf2uf2/releases[elf2uf2]
- for automatic generated documentation you need http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/[Doxygen]

== pinout

=== pico
The pico has 40 pins (1..40) Numbered counter clock wise starting at the USB connector.
